        In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall 
        <br> within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the 
        <br>kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones
        <br> that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:
        </i></p>

   <ol>
       <li>
           <i>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol(C<sup>14</sup>H<sup>1203</sup>). </li>
   <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30<sup>°</sup>C (86 <sup>°</sup>F), when 
   audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
    <li>Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</li>
   </i></ol>

    <p><i>Can you provide <a href="http://example.com.">us</a> with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the
